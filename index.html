It eventually flew to over 65 destinations in India and across the world, including Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and North America, with hubs in Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, and gateways in Amsterdam, Paris, London, and Abu Dhabi. It flew 124 narrow-body and wide-body aircraft on nearly 1000 domestic and international routes, before it suspended operations in April 2019.</p>
